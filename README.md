## <samp><strong>Hi there 👋</strong></samp>


Skilled IT **professional** with a strong background in systems administration, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. Technical expertise includes a variety of programming languages, cloud platforms, and development tools.

##  🧠 Experience

In my current role, I work as a Systems Administrator for a local University. My responsibilities have included overseeing comprehensive server upgrades and conducting thorough vulnerability assessments, ensuring our systems remain robust against evolving cyber threats.

In my day-to-day work, I do a lot of scripting and automating to make things run smoother and more efficiently. I mainly use [`PowerShell`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) and [`Bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for this – they're my go-to tools for getting the job done right.
